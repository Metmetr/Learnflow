I want to restructure my website. It should become a social learning platform where all content is automatically generated by an AI bot (named Jarvis), and users can only interact with that content.

Here is exactly how the site should work:

= Removing Completely =
- All educator/teacher verification (SheerID)
- Any teacher roles, educator badges, or moderation/verification flows
- Ability for users to upload/create content or publish posts
- Teacher onboarding, teacher registration, or verification flows
- Any UI related to teachers or educator verification

= Keeping (Must Stay) =
- User accounts (login/register using Replit Auth)
- User profiles
- Social features: likes, comments, bookmarks/saves
- Notifications
- Admin access for me (to manage or view system)

= New Structure to Build =
- Add a dedicated AI bot account named “Jarvis”
- Jarvis will be the ONLY content publisher on the site
- Create a secure API endpoint for n8n to publish content:
  POST /api/jarvis/post
  - Must require a secret API key in request header
  - Should automatically publish content (no approval needed)
  - Content must be saved in the current database schema

- The homepage should show an infinite feed of Jarvis-generated posts (like Instagram/TikTok feed style but with articles/learning content)

- Users can:
  ✔ like posts
  ✔ comment on posts
  ✔ save/bookmark posts
  ❌ but cannot create/upload content

- Profile page should show:
  - User info
  - Posts they liked or saved (NOT posts they created, because no user posts exist)

- Jarvis should have a visible profile page that lists ALL AI-generated content

= Extra Important Rules =
- Remove all UI text saying “verified teachers”
- Remove any SheerID references
- Remove any button for “Add Content”, “Upload”, or “Become an Educator”
- Make the platform focused on learning through AI-generated content + community interaction

Final Vision:
A social education platform similar to Instagram/Medium, but all content is automatically generated by an AI bot (Jarvis). Users only interact with the content socially (like, comment, bookmark).
