I want to redesign my homepage and overall UI to match the new system where all content is generated by an AI bot named Jarvis. The platform is no longer educator-based, and there should be no teacher roles, teacher cards, SheerID elements, or verified educator sections.

Here is exactly what I want:

-------------------------------------------------------
REMOVE COMPLETELY:
-------------------------------------------------------
- All teacher cards (profile images, names like Dr. Ayşe Yılmaz, Prof. Dr. Mehmet Kaya, etc.)
- Any “Doğrulanmış İçerik”, “Güvenilir Eğitimciler”, “Kişiselleştirilmiş Öğrenme” info boxes
- Any SheerID text or banners (“Eğitimci misiniz?”, “Eğitimci olarak katıl”)
- Any UI text that refers to educators, verified educators, academic experts, or content verification
- The “Öne Çıkan İçerikler” teacher-based section
- Any educator-specific CTA buttons

-------------------------------------------------------
KEEP AND REDESIGN:
-------------------------------------------------------
The homepage must be redesigned to match a modern AI-powered learning feed. 
The new hero section should be minimal and AI-focused.

-------------------------------------------------------
NEW HOMEPAGE DESIGN:
-------------------------------------------------------

1) HERO SECTION:
- Large hero image is allowed
- Title should be simple and AI-focused, for example:
  “Jarvis ile Kişisel Eğitim İçerikleri”
  OR
  “AI-Generated Learning Content”
- Remove teacher references
- Add a search bar below the title
- Add category buttons (Matematik, Fizik, Tarih, Biyoloji, vb.)
- Overall style: modern, clean, minimal

2) CONTENT FEED:
Replace teacher-produced posts with a feed of AI-generated posts by Jarvis.
Each content card should show:
- The title
- The thumbnail image
- A short excerpt
- Interaction buttons: like, bookmark/save, comment
- Author section should always show:
  Avatar: Jarvis robot icon
  Name: “Jarvis (AI)”

3) NO USER CONTENT CREATION:
Users cannot upload or create content.
They should only be able to:
- like
- comment
- bookmark/save
- explore AI feed

4) REMOVE ANY EDUCATOR REFERENCES:
Remove all UI elements, text blocks, components, or sections that mention:
- teachers
- educators
- academic experts
- SheerID verification
- verified content
- educator join section

5) FOOTER SHOULD BE SIMPLE:
Keep only necessary links:
- Hakkımızda
- Gizlilik
- Kullanım Koşulları
- İletişim

-------------------------------------------------------
GOAL:
-------------------------------------------------------
The homepage must look like a modern AI-powered educational feed (Instagram + Medium style), with ONLY Jarvis-generated content visible and ZERO teacher/educator elements remaining.

Rebuild and clean up all related components accordingly.
